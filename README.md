# COE328-Term-Project
Designed a general purpose processor using VHDL coding, capable of basic logical functions according to designated microcodes. Used in the block diagram design are two latches, one 4to16 decoder, one Moore FSM, and an ASU. Compilation, analysis, and synthesize was verified using waveform simulations via the Quartus 13.0 simulator.
